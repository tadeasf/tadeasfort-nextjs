I've been taking pictures actively since 2015. I even tried to make a living out of it for a while, before the Covid outbreak. And, well, at the beggining I shot exclusively on film - first using 35mm cameras, later medium format beasts like Zenza Bronica S2a, SQ-A or Yashica D.

What is more, I learned how to develop my own negatives and scanned them on a flatbed as well. I'll post some articles about these practices soon in form of tutorial.
